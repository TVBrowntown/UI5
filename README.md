# UI5
UI5 is a UI project of mine for Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning.

It is a lesson in programming with lua for myself and is currently in alpha.

what does it have?

oHUD that flashes white and jiggles of critical hit
oHUD that also has a fading HP bar to show a visual indicator of how much damage is done
new main HP bars
new mechanic bar
danger monitor (to see who is doing DBs and animates a flame on their mainbar when targetted)
shitter icon for when you target someone who you have decided is a twat /shitter <name> and /noshit <name> to remove them. /shitters to see a list of your current shitters
updated peaceout addon with no errors
modified Obsidian addon for castbar
modified TexturedButtons addon for textured hotbar

intended features for the future (depending if I can motivate myself to do these as I don't really play WAR much anymore):

warband and party UI
spell suggestion module - a dynamic spell priority queue that displays a list of spells you could cast depending on enemy HP, if they have a debuff/buff, etc.
updated character sheet, quit menu, chat window, inventory window, notification/alert window.
