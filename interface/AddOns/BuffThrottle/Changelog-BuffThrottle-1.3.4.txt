	* BuffThrottle.lua:
	Make BuffThrottle always pass through Clear() calls - while
	BuffThrottle shouldn't be necessary after the 1.1 patch, at least
	this way people who autoupdate their addons or just update without
	reading notes won't come complaining to me that buffs are sticking
	around. Hopefully.
